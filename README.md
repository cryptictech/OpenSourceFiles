# My Open Source Notes
 An open source collection of my notes on various subjects like math, computer science, and more!

 These notes may not be a comprehensive study guide, they're not meant to prepare for any exam, course, or field of work, I'm simply taking the time to research topics that interest me so that I can apply them in my work.

 ## Contributing

 Contributions are welcome! I would love to learn new concepts and make these notes more complete and discover areas of interest that I may not have thought of. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
